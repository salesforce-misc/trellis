# Data-type support matrix

Which PostgreSQL data types Trellis supports, in **which role**. A living
reference, updated as each type/role lands. Driven by
[Epic #123](https://github.com/salesforce-misc/trellis/issues/123); the
candidacy constraint is
[ADR-0004](decisions/0004-transform-definition-grammar.md).

A type is never simply "supported." It earns its way into six roles, ordered
**floor → ceiling** — the matrix doubles as a maturity ladder, and most types
climb it left-to-right:

1. **Ingest / passthrough** — decode from logical replication and copy into a
   derived table unchanged. The floor under every other role, and nearly
   everything clears it: unmapped types fall through to `Text`, keeping the
   source's concrete PG type (`trellis/src/defs/ddl.rs:293-324`).
2. **Filter (predicate)** — appear in a `WHERE` predicate. Needs immutable
   comparison operators and the predicate grammar (stubbed to `TRUE` today,
   `ast.rs:185`).
3. **Join / relationship / `GROUP BY` key** — be matched by equality. Today via
   raw `::text` rendering (`TEXT_STABLE_JOIN_KEY_TYPES`,
   `trellis/src/defs/catalog.rs:2156`; `to_rows_by_key`, `eval.rs:65-106`).
4. **Primary key** — identify a target row. A stricter join key: it must come
   from the source's replica identity and present in the old-image for
   updates/deletes. Gated to the join-key-safe allowlist
   (`is_text_stable_join_key_type`) — an unsafe single-column PK
   (`numeric`/`timestamptz`/`bytea`, which `::text`-matching would silently
   mismatch) is rejected at define time with `DdlError::UnsupportedPrimaryKeyType`
   (#107). The typed key index (below) later unlocks those types as safe keys.
5. **Computed 1-1 target** — a scalar calculated field *produces* this type
   (distinct from passthrough). Needs an immutable evaluator arm **and** grammar
   to spell a literal/cast of the type.
6. **Aggregate target** — an aggregate calculated field folds to this type.
   Gated by fold economics: `SUM`/`COUNT`/`AVG` invertible (cheap deltas);
   `MIN`/`MAX` orderable-but-not-invertible; `array_agg`/`string_agg`/`jsonb_agg`
   order-sensitive.

## Legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | works today |
| 🎯 | in scope for the epic |
| ⚠️ | conditional / needs design decision |
| ❌ | excluded (immutability or no equality) |
| — | not applicable |

`COUNT(*)` is type-agnostic row-counting (`registry.rs:160`, #75) — not a
per-type capability, so it's omitted from the aggregate cells.

| `oid` | ✅ | 🎯 | 🎯 | 🎯 | 🎯 | — | behaves like `int`; low priority |

## The immutability gate

ADR-0004 admits only operators/functions whose output depends solely on their
inputs. `pg_proc.provolatile` is the ground truth — several intuitions are wrong:

* **`money`** — comparison (`cash_eq`/`cash_cmp`) *is* immutable, but text I/O
  (`cash_out`) is `STABLE` (`lc_monetary`), so the CDC-decoded text is
  locale-dependent. Excluded; use `numeric`.
* **`json`** — has *no* `=` operator; can never be a key. `jsonb` can.
* **`text`/`varchar`/`char`** — Postgres marks these comparisons IMMUTABLE
  despite collation-sensitivity. Our own bar is a **deterministic collation** (or
  a normalized stored form); `char(n)`'s hazard is blank-padding, not volatility.
* **`timestamptz`/`bytea`** — value comparison immutable, but *text rendering*
  is GUC-dependent (`TimeZone`, `bytea_output`). This is why a **typed key
  index** — comparing decoded values, not text — is the real unlock.
* **`jsonb_agg`** — marked `STABLE` in Postgres; whether Trellis's own
  deterministic reimplementation may treat it as immutable is an open question.
* **`xml`/`tsvector`/`tsquery`** — no useful immutable equality/ordering; niche.

## Cross-cutting concerns

* **Casts / coercion lattice** — computing a new type needs literal and `CAST`
  grammar (numeric + quoted-text literals only today); own epic child.
* **Typed key index** — replacing the raw-`::text` match unlocks
  `timestamp`/`bytea`/`date`/`numeric`/… as safe keys; the single
  highest-leverage child for the key roles.
* **Aggregate maintenance** — order-sensitive aggregates (`array_agg`,
  `string_agg`, `jsonb_agg`) need an incremental-delta design or a
  group-recompute fallback, and an `ORDER BY`-inside-aggregate grammar decision.
